# @tomhazledine/svg-graph-toolkit

This is a set of helper functions and React components that I commonly use when generating SVG graphs in my projects. I like to hand-roll SVG graphs with JSX and D3, but there are inevitably certain things that I need to do over and over again. I've created this library to DRY out my graphing projects and avoid re-work.
